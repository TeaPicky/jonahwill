            <h4>1 - Insults</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>1.1 - Any type of bullying, insulting, or language which may make another player uncomfortable is prohibited.
            <br>1.2 - Racism, homophobia, sexism, xenophobia, or any discrimination based on a <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/protected-characteristics" target="_blank">protected characteristic</a> is prohibited and will result in an immediate ban from the Minecraft and Discord servers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>2 - Advertising</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>2.1 - Advertising your own service, or a service which has given/will give you rewards for advertisement (we include social media, VOD platforms (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.), and streaming platforms within this definition.) is strictly prohibited.
            <br>2.2 - Advertisement is only permitted for users who have discussed this with the head-staff team and Jonah. Upon a successful agreement, you would be permitted to advertise on the server (and/or Discord servers).
            <br>2.3 - We (staff of jonahwill.org) reserve the right to remove any messages which seem to break point 2.1 until a review of said messages is complete.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>3 - Spam</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>3.1 - We define spam as messages/builds with no particular meaning (or for buildings, effort).
            <br>3.2 - Excessively repeated messages (regardless of meaning) are also classified as spam.
            <br>3.3 - Spamming messages at any interval is also prohibited.
            <br>3.4 - Using macros/hotkeys or anything similar is prohibited (with regards to auto-sending messages).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>4 - Reporting Infractions</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>4.1 - If you notice someone breaking any of the rules listed here please use the correct channels for doing so.
                <br>4.1.1 - For the Minecraft server you can: Run this command if there is no staff online and it will be investigated as soon as a staff member comes online <code>/report &#60;username&#62; &#60;reason&#62;</code> Alternatively, if there is staff online use <code>/helpop &#60;description of your issue&#62;</code>. If the previous options are unapplicable please open a ticket on our <a href="/discord">Minecraft Discord Server</a>.
                <br>4.1.2 - For the Discord-related issues, either @ any staff member (servants on the main Discord or Mod and above on the Minecraft Discord) or direct message a staff member. Head-staff are the primary port-of-call for any issues or complaints relating to staff.
            <br>4.2 - If the infraction is concerning enough, we reserve the right to pass on any information we have to the appropriate organisation/third-party (Discord or Mojang for example).
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>5 - Use of Clients</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>5.1 - We permit the use of third-party clients/launchers.
            <br>5.2 - If you decide to use a third-party client/launcher, you accept full responsibility for the use of any performance/advantage-giving enhancements. Stating that a specific client is distributed with for example, fly-speed enhancements, is not an accepted reason for a ban-appeal.
            <br>5.3 - The use of any advantage-giving clients is strictly prohibited. If you are detected as using any features of a client which give you an un-fair advantage, or which alter the default behaviour of your character in-game is prohibited (kill aurora etc.).
            <br>5.4 - If you are unsure whether a feature of a client is permitted, please contact the server developers through the ticket system on the <a href="discord">Minecraft Discord</a>.</p>
